- FoldingProject.java
calcSCFG(), 1)do inside first, 2)then outside, 3)then setting s and d prob, 4)then expectation.

if do 4) before 3), then get a different expectation E1. 
if do 1) again after 3), then get a different inside (the one I need, I1).
if do 2) again after 3), then get a different outside O1, and a different expectation in 4) but same value as E1! 

step 2) will reset the base pairs probs

the s and d prob setting part of 3) only change the scfg rule probs for terminals; the entropy calculation(EM algorithm) part of 3) actually does not change the scfg rule probs for terminal parts
so where does the constraint add to scfg probs?

probmatrix is getting from phylo part, then combined with constraints;probmatrix2 is probmatrix with diffbp==true


- PPfold.main calls thread.start(), where thread is a PPfoldMain object


- Parameters.java: 
Reads and stores the input parameters (scfg, paired and un-paired prob, etc) at res/matrices.in
The scfg rule probs are in param and prob[][] in most of the scripts


- PPfoldMain.fold() is in charge of folding


- ForcedConstraints.java:
read in constraints like:
To force a region of length k, starting with nucleotide i, to be unpaired:
P i 0 k 
data[i][j]==2 and data[i][i]==3 correspond to single-stranded constraints


- ForcedConstraints is one of the ExtraData list


- Inside.java
build the three n*n matrices L, S, F for all the grammers
bifurcation happens when S->LS and F->LS
