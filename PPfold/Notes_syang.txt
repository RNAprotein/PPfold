- Parameters.java: 
Reads and stores the input parameters (scfg, paired and un-paired prob, etc) at res/matrices.in


- PPfoldMain.fold() is in charge of folding


- ForcedConstraints.java:
read in constraints like:
To force a region of length k, starting with nucleotide i, to be unpaired:
P i 0 k 
data[i][j]==2 and data[i][i]==3 correspond to single-stranded constraints
